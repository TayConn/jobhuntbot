üîÑ HOW IT WORKS
===============

‚Ä¢ The bot automatically checks for new jobs every 2 hours
‚Ä¢ When new jobs are found, they're posted to the channel
‚Ä¢ Jobs are filtered based on your preferences (if any)
‚Ä¢ Duplicate jobs are automatically filtered out
‚Ä¢ You can manually check for jobs anytime with !checknow
‚Ä¢ NEW: Interactive UI makes it easy to set preferences and search!

‚öôÔ∏è PREFERENCE LOGIC
===================

‚Ä¢ CATEGORIES: Jobs must contain your subscribed categories in the title
‚Ä¢ LOCATIONS: Jobs must contain your location preferences in the location field
‚Ä¢ COMPANIES: Jobs must be from your preferred companies
‚Ä¢ If you have no preferences set, you'll see ALL jobs
‚Ä¢ All preferences are case-insensitive

üîß TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

Q: I'm not getting any job notifications
A: Try !checknow to manually check, or !preferences to verify your settings

Q: I'm getting too many notifications
A: Use !subscribe to add more specific categories, or !addlocation to filter by location

Q: I want to see all jobs regardless of preferences
A: Use !clearpreferences to remove all filters

Q: How do I use the interactive UI?
A: Just type the command without arguments (e.g., !dumpjobs) and follow the emoji prompts!

Q: The interactive UI isn't responding
A: Make sure you're reacting to the bot's message, not typing commands. Sessions expire after 30 minutes.

Q: I'm stuck in an interactive session
A: Use !cancel to cancel your active session, or wait 30 minutes for it to expire automatically.

Q: I can't start a new interactive session
A: You can only have one active session at a time. Use !cancel to end your current session first.

üìû NEED HELP?
=============

If you're having issues:
1. Try !bothelp for a quick command reference
2. Check your preferences with !preferences
3. Use !checknow to test if the bot is working
4. Ask a server admin if the bot appears offline

üéØ PRO TIPS
===========

‚Ä¢ Use the interactive UI for easier preference management
‚Ä¢ Interactive sessions expire after 30 minutes - complete them quickly
‚Ä¢ You can only have one active session at a time - use !cancel if you get stuck
‚Ä¢ The üü¢ (green circle) advances to the next step, üîÑ restarts the flow, ‚ùå cancels
‚Ä¢ Previous step messages are automatically cleaned up to reduce clutter
‚Ä¢ You can still use command arguments for quick actions (e.g., !subscribe backend)
‚Ä¢ Large job search results are automatically sent as files
‚Ä¢ The bot automatically filters out duplicate jobs, so you won't see the same job twice
