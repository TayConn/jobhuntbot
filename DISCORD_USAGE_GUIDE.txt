üîÑ HOW IT WORKS
===============

‚Ä¢ The bot automatically checks for new jobs every 2 hours
‚Ä¢ When new jobs are found, they're posted to the channel
‚Ä¢ Jobs are filtered based on your preferences (if any)
‚Ä¢ Duplicate jobs are automatically filtered out
‚Ä¢ You can manually check for jobs anytime with !checknow

‚öôÔ∏è PREFERENCE LOGIC
===================

‚Ä¢ CATEGORIES: Jobs must contain your subscribed categories in the title
‚Ä¢ LOCATIONS: Jobs must contain your location preferences in the location field
‚Ä¢ COMPANIES: Jobs must be from your preferred companies
‚Ä¢ If you have no preferences set, you'll see ALL jobs
‚Ä¢ All preferences are case-insensitive

üîß TROUBLESHOOTING
==================

Q: I'm not getting any job notifications
A: Try !checknow to manually check, or !preferences to verify your settings

Q: I'm getting too many notifications
A: Use !subscribe to add more specific categories, or !addlocation to filter by location

Q: I want to see all jobs regardless of preferences
A: Use !clearpreferences to remove all filters

Q: How do I see what categories are available?
A: Use !subscribe without any arguments to see the full list

üìû NEED HELP?
=============

If you're having issues:
1. Try !help for a quick command reference
2. Check your preferences with !preferences
3. Use !checknow to test if the bot is working
4. Ask a server admin if the bot appears offline

üéØ PRO TIPS
===========

‚Ä¢ Use specific categories like "frontend" instead of "engineer" for better filtering
‚Ä¢ Add "Remote" as a location if you're open to remote work
‚Ä¢ Subscribe to multiple categories to cast a wider net
‚Ä¢ Use !dumpjobs to see what's currently available before setting preferences
‚Ä¢ The bot automatically filters out duplicate jobs, so you won't see the same job twice
